# The Idea of Automating Basic Computer Processes

# Introduction

 Automating code and commands may make an influence on the time we spend struggling with the complicated commands and processes that need effort and knowledge. For example, we don't have to remember the command for displaying our ip address, so we can just make a program called 'showip' and set it to show our ip address and run it whenever we want. Another instance how helpful this idea can be is automating progresses we do daily or regularly. Some of these can be things like opening bunch of websites focusing on a concept, writing something that you use a lot, joining online lessons, etc. In addition, you can learn and add useful abilities that your computer is capable of doing such as youtube(mp3)downloader from terminal, sms sender, testing internet speed, math calculations, etc.

 To continue, I would like to argue that without automated programs,the efforts we put in our daily work can be considered as being primitive and redundant, and can be obviated with coding. The assertion isn't quitting sports and turning into robots, but unnecessary effort spent every second isn't very beneficial and, I would say, the enemy of intellect. To explain the phrase 'enemy of intellect' furthermore, every time we spend time on something that we could have automated before, it is a waste of time and effort. If the person repeats doing the same behavior over and over, the person is not using his/her intellectual abilities effectively.  


# About the Sample Project (extra-console)

 The sample project, namely the extra-console, comprises some functions that will save me from spending extra effort. It also includes some interesting abilities like I mentioned earlier while I was speaking about automated coding in the introduction section. The extra-console is written in pure C and extended with Python to do such intriguing things that I couldn't figure out how to do with C. Along with, the code uses the system() function too much and includes, for the macchanger, shell script so it is platform specific.
 
 To be objective, extra-console is a terrible program to use. Well at least, I am not going to use it. However, in my opinion, it is the best way to demonstrate my idea of autamated codes. So, the program is actually nothing much more than a simple illustration of my idea that I am proposing.  
 
# Installer 

 It's pure C and, just like the program itself, is platform specific. I added the installer program so that you don't have to compile anything. One thing to note is that I used the directory path names manually, which I regreted later. So, do not change directory names or move them to preserve the program's flow between directories.
