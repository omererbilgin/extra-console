# extra-console

# Introduction

 The idea is that, automating code and commands, may make an influence on the time we spend struggling with the complicated commands and processes that needs effort and knowledge. For example, we don't have to remember the command for displaying our ip address, so we can just make a program called 'showip' and set it to show us our ip address and call it whenever we want. Another instance how helpful this idea can be is automating progresses we do daily or regularly. Some of these can be things like oppening bunch of websites for some concept, write something that you use a lot, joining online lessons etc. In addition, you can learn and add useful abilities that your computer is capable to do like youtube(mp3)downloader from terminal, sms sender, test internet speed, math calculations etc.

 To continue, another view of the idea is indicating all primitive human efforts are redundant and can be obviated with coding. The assertion isn't quitting sports and turning into robots, but unnecessary effort spent every second isn't very beneficial and, I would say, the enemy of intellect. To explain furthermore the phrase 'enemy of intellect', every time we spare time for something that we could automate before, it comes back as loss of time and effort, which doing the same mistake perpetually and staying neutral about it can just mean that the aforementioned person is making concessions of his/her intellectual abilities, which I would not recommend, or he/she is unconcious about his/her behaviors and its returns. 


# About the Code

 The sample project comprises some functions that will rescue me from extra effort and some interesting abilities like I mentioned earlier while I was speaking about my idea. It is written in pure C and extended with Python to do such intriguing things that I couldn't figure out how to with C. Along with, the code uses the system() function too much and includes, for the macchanger, shell script so it is not platform specific.
 
 To be objective, extra-console is a terrible program to use. Well at least I am not going to use. However, in my opinion, it is the best way to demonstrate my idea or how it would be like to have your own automated programs/commands. So the program is actually nothing much more than a simple illustration of my idea that I am proposing.  
 
# Installer 

 It's pure C and, just like the program itself, program specific. I added the installer program so you don't have to compile anything. One thing to note is that I used the directory path names manually, which I regreted latter, so do not change directory names or change them to preserve to programs flow between directories.
